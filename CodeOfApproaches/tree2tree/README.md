# treelstm-code-generation

This repository contains implementation Tree2tree model on PyTorch from my diploma project 'Generation of code from text description with syntactic 
parsing and Tree2Tree model'. It is mostly inspired by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01696) and similar in implementation to [NL2code](https://github.com/neulab/NL2code). 

To start, just run 

```
sh fetch_and_preprocess.sh
python experiment_{hs|django}.py
```
