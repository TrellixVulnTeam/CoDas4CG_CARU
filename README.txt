Contests based Dataset for Code Generation

There are Four folders: Dataset, TestCases, Tools and GeneratedPrograms.

/Dataset contains the programming tasks and their corresponding implementations in different programming languages. Each subfolder under /Datset corresponds to a single programming task. Notably, we do not include the commercial script to crawl data.

/TestCases contains the test cases for the programming tasks in folder /Dataset. The names of the subfolders in /TestCases specify the names of the programming tasks. According to such names you may find the corresponding tasks under /Dataset. Notably, such test cases are collected from programming contest websites, and we do not leverage test case generation tools.

/Tools contains the source code of our tool kit.

/GeneratedPrograms contains the programs generated by each approach.

/CodeOfApproaches  Implementation of evaluated approaches.
