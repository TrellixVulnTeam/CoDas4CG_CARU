Contests based Dataset for Code Generation

There are three folders: Dataset, TestCases, and Tools.

/Dataset contains the programming tasks and their corresponding implementations in different programming languages. Each subfolder under /Datset corresponds to a single programming task.

/TestCases contains the test cases for the programming tasks in folder /Dataset. The names of the subfolders in /TestCases specify the names of the programming tasks. According to such names you may find the corresponding tasks under /Dataset.

/Tools contains the source code of our tool kit.

Notably, the dataset is large and it may take time to upload all the data. As a result, the data may be incomplete at this time. 
*This warning would be removed once the upload is completed.
