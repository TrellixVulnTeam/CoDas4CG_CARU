Contests based Dataset for Code Generation

If you are using the dataset, please cite the following paper: H. Liu, M. Shen, J. Zhu, N. Niu, G. Li and L. Zhang, "Deep Learning Based Program Generation from Requirements Text: Are We There Yet?," in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2020.3018481.

There are Seven folders: Compute, sql, Dataset, TestCases, Tools, CodeOfApproaches and GeneratedPrograms.

/Compute contains the file to compute bleu

/sql Database contains the whole dataset (Python only). 

/Dataset contains the programming tasks and their corresponding implementations in different programming languages. Each subfolder under /Datset corresponds to a single programming task. Notably, we do not include the commercial script to crawl data.

/TestCases contains the test cases for the programming tasks in folder /Dataset. The names of the subfolders in /TestCases specify the names of the programming tasks. According to such names you may find the corresponding tasks under /Dataset. Notably, such test cases are collected from programming contest websites, and we do not leverage test case generation tools.

/Tools contains the source code of our tool kit.

/GeneratedPrograms contains the programs generated by each approach.

/CodeOfApproaches Implementation of evaluated approaches.


APIs in /sql 

#To retrieve data
RetrieveTasks():select question from process_question 
RetrieveTasks(ID): select question from process_question where numId = ID
RetreiveImplementations（）:select code from process_implements 
RetreiveImplementations（ID）:select code from process_implements where numId = ID
#处理后数据
RetrieveTasks():select process_question from process_question 
RetrieveTasks(ID): select process_question from process_question where numId = ID
RetreiveImplementations（）:select process_code from process_implements 
RetreiveImplementations（ID）:select process_code from process_implements where numId = ID
#测试用例
RetreiveTestCasess（ID）: select input,output from testcase where numId= ID
