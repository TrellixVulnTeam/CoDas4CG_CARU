Contests based Dataset for Code Generation

If you are using the dataset, please cite the following paper: H. Liu, M. Shen, J. Zhu, N. Niu, G. Li and L. Zhang, "Deep Learning Based Program Generation from Requirements Text: Are We There Yet?," in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2020.3018481.

There are Seven folders: Compute, sql, Dataset, TestCases, Tools, CodeOfApproaches and GeneratedPrograms.


/Dataset contains the programming tasks and their corresponding implementations in different programming languages. Each subfolder under /Datset corresponds to a single programming task. Notably, we do not include the commercial script to crawl data.

/TestCases contains the test cases for the programming tasks in folder /Dataset. The names of the subfolders in /TestCases specify the names of the programming tasks. According to such names you may find the corresponding tasks under /Dataset. Notably, such test cases are collected from programming contest websites, and we do not leverage test case generation tools.

/Tools contains the source code of our tool kit.

/GeneratedPrograms contains the programs generated by each approach.

/CodeOfApproaches Implementation of evaluated approaches.


#  /sql: This folder is composed of a databasethat contains the whole dataset (Python only).

### How to use the database:

#Retrieving original data
1. RetrieveTasks(): Returns the description (requirements) of all tasks, each requirement is a text string

    SQL: select question from question 
2. RetrieveTask(ID): Return the task description of the specified ID   

    SQL: select question from question where numId = ID
3. RetreiveImplementations()：Return all codes, and each code corresponds to a python file.

	SQL：select code from code
4. RetreiveImplementations（ID）：Return all codes corresponding to the specified topic id, and each code corresponds to a python file.	 s

	SQL: select code from code where numId = ID

#Retrieving processed data

Processed data is the requirement description and source code obtained after preprocessing such as word segmentation and lowercase words.

1. RetrieveTasks(): Returns the description (requirements) of all tasks, each requirement is a text string

    SQL: select question from process_question 
2. RetrieveTask(ID): Return the task description of the specified ID   

    SQL: select question from process_question where numId = ID
3. RetreiveImplementations()：Return all codes, and each code corresponds to a python file.

	SQL：select code from process_code
4. RetreiveImplementations（ID）：Return all codes corresponding to the specified topic id, and each code corresponds to a python file.	 

	SQL: select code from process_code where numId = ID

RetreiveTestCasess（ID）：Returns the test case corresponding to the specified question id.

	SQL:select input,output from testcase where numId= ID


#  /Compute: This folder contains how to calculate the belu value between the source code, preprocessing code, and code to detect whether it contains compilation errors, etc.

 1.ComputeBLEU（pred, refer）: Calculate the BLEU between the generated code pred and the reference code refer	

 2.ComputeBLEU2（pred,refers）:Calculate the BLEU of code pred according to a series of refer	

 3.hasCompilerErrors（File name）:Check whether the code has static detection and dynamic compilation errors	

 4.PreProcessALL(File requirements， File implements): Return after preprocessing related requirements and codes	

 5.PreProcessReq(File requirements， File implements): Return after preprocessing related requirements
				
6.PreProcessImp(File requirements， File implements): Return after preprocessing the relevant code
